## 3.1 What's a matrix?

In R, a matrix is a collection of elements of the same data type (numeric, character, or logical) arranged into
a fixed number of rows and columns. Since you are only working with rows and columns, a matrix is called
two-dimensional.
You can construct a matrix in R with the matrix() function. Consider the following example:

```{r example 3.1, exercise = TRUE}
matrix(1:9, byrow = TRUE, nrow = 3)
```
